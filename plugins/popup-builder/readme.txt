While sharing your ideas and viewpoints online, it is not always convenient and/or adequate to include in the given text all the info you've got. On the other hand, it may be rather important not to ignore the possible extra pieces of information, especially if you aim to satisfy the needs of a manifold audience. But how can this be achieved? Is there a correspondent tool for it? 
The HTML popup we offer is quite a popular solution. Having installed it, you are enabled to be brief but share a pack of information if you wish. All kind of associations connected with any part of your material can be presented with the help of a simple redirection.
There are several options' sections available where you can configure the popup up to your needs. First you can see about the way the popup looks by choosing the theme and effect types applied to it and deciding the appropriate dimensions. Then, you are able to manage when and where the popup turns up. It can appear while scrolling the page, remain unchangeable or be resized according to the window. Meanwhile, the popup can be chosen to close either automatically or by hand. Also, you can decide on its availability on different devices (PC, mobile, etc.).

There is also the possibility to specify how long the ready-made popup appearance should be delayed after loading the page (in sec).
With the help of both basic and advanced options, you are able to freely regulate the dismissal, display, colour and location of the image popup. It can appear at the top right/left corner, at the bottom or in the centre. You can choose to show the popup whenever the user scrolls the page or ensure its permanent occurrence by disabling popup closing in any possible way.
